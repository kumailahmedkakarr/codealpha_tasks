Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
Task 4 - Code Alpha Internship
Prepared by: KUMAIL AHMED


Introduction
IDS (Intrusion Detection System) monitors network traffic.
 Detects suspicious activity like hacking attempts or port scans.
 Acts as a security guard for the network.

Tool Used: Snort
Snort is an open-source IDS.
 Can analyze live network traffic.
 Uses rules to detect malicious activity.
 Logs and alerts when threats are found.

Setup Steps
1. Install Snort: sudo apt install snort -y
2. Create/Edit local.rules file.
3. Add custom rule for Telnet detection.
4. Run Snort with the rule enabled.
5. Generate traffic (e.g., Telnet test).

Custom Rule Example
alert tcp any any -> any 23 (msg:"Telnet Attempt Detected"; sid:1000001;)

Detects any Telnet connection attempt (port 23).
Triggers an alert with custom message.


Example Output
[**] [1:1000001:0] Telnet Attempt Detected [**]

Testing IDS
 Run Snort: sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.lua -R /etc/snort/rules/local.rules -i wlan0 --alert-fast stdout
 Open another terminal and run: telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
 Snort should display an alert in the console.


Conclusion
 IDS is effective for detecting suspicious activity.
 Snort successfully detected Telnet traffic.
Provides better network security through monitoring and alerts.
